# Linear-Algebra-C

A linear algebra library for performing basic and advanced matrix operations. 
This was made as a refresher for linear algebra.


I did a basic refresher with Elementary Linear Algebra 10th Ed, the book I used in a previous course.


## Note
Every function is based around my struct **matrix** which contains width, height, and data. I did not make 
a separate **vector** struct since a vector is just a one dimensional matrix.

Every element of a matrix is a double, this makes it the most flexible for doing math with.
